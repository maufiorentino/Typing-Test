# Typing Speed Game

How fast are your fingers? Do the one-minute typing test to find out! Press the space bar after each word. At the end, you'll get your typing speed in CPM and WPM. Good luck!
The game is available in 3 languages, English, Spanish and Italian and you can also change them while you are playing to test your multilingual knowledge.

## What are CPM and WPM?

They're short for Characters Per Minute, and Words Per Minute. The "raw CPM" is the actual number of characters you type per minute, including all the mistakes. "Corrected" scores count only correctly typed words. "WPM" is just the corrected CPM divided by 5. That's a de facto international standard.

### Why are there no difficult words in this test?

The words are selected from a list of commonly used words. Some typing speed tests use words with difficult spellings, but I think that's unfair. I want to measure typing speed, not reading skill! The lack of difficult words in this test also enables this site to be used as a typing game for kids.

### Does speed matter?

Only if you're not fast enough. :)
